Does Bone Broth Supplement Calcium? I am five months pregnant. When I went to the hospital for an examination last time, the doctor said that I need to supplement calcium now, so he prescribed calcium tablets for me, but I found that I became constipated when I took calcium tablets. I wanted to drink milk, but I was very special. I hate the taste. My mother said that drinking some bone soup often can replenish calcium. Is it true? May I ask if regular drinking of bone broth can supplement calcium? How much should I drink every day?Bone broth contains a certain amount of nutrients, such as protein and fat, which are beneficial to human health. However, the calcium content in bone broth is negligible, and it lacks vitamin D, which can promote calcium absorption. If you only rely on drinking soup to meet calcium supplementation, you need to drink at least 400 bowls of bone soup every day, so drinking bone soup alone cannot achieve the purpose of calcium supplementation. In fact, the scientific method of calcium supplementation is very simple, as long as you follow the scientific and reasonable dietary principles, take a diversified and balanced diet, and pay more attention to the intake of milk and soy products in your daily diet.	1
